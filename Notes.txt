----------------------------------How to build a Bash script
Nano = to create a script
	Nano = Create a new script
	Nano scriptName = create an existing script
Cntrl + O = Save and then enter
Cntrl + X = Exit from nano

#!/bin/bash = what kind of script we are writing

0 = successful; 1-255 = unsuccessful = This tell the shel if the commands run correctly

chmod [permission] [file_name] = Define permission to the file
	*Example: chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx [file_name]
		-Define accessibility for the user/owner (u), group (g), and others (o).
		-Followed by the equal sign (=) and the first letter of the read (r), write (w) and/or execute (x) privileges.
	*Example 2: chmod 644 test.txt = 6: for the user, 4: group, the other 4: others
		-7 = for read, write, and execute permission
		-6 = for read and write privileges
		-5 = for read and execute privileges
		-4 = for read privileges
		-0 = for no privileges
	
Ls -l = See the permissions, if it starts with - it is a file, but d it is a folder 

.tar = .zip

-it = Correr el bash pero espere a que yo le de entrada, porque es interactivo

Mv scriptName folderToMove = to move 1 file a folder

Ls -a = to show hidden files

PATH variable = Tell the shell where to search for executable files, it constain the list of folders that the shell will search for executeble files to run as command names
	*echo $PATH
Inside .profile or .bash_profile we can add the following line to make it global
	*Export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/PathOfScript": to edit it we use 'nano' command

Source pathFile = To reload the file without restart the terminal
